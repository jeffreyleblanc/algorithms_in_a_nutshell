Algorithms implemented from the book:

* Convex Hull
* KDTree static construction
* KDTree based nearest neighbor query
* KDTree based region query

These are implemented in javascript using wickk to provide a visual framework.

Line Sweep is not implemented at this time. The ratio of complexity to payoff
made it less interesting to implement at this time.
